## Hi there 👋

I'm Alok, a tech student and beginner developer from India.
I like learning technology by doing practical work.
If I learn a new concept, I try to code it and understand it deeply.
I focus on building strong basics and improving step by step.

My main tech stack is Python, Java basic programming, and problem solving.
I enjoy working on simple programs like patterns, logic problems, and beginner projects.
I also explore GitHub, LinkedIn, and certifications to grow professionally.

I've shared several practice programs and learning projects here.
My goal is to become confident in coding and software development through consistency.
I believe small progress every day leads to big results.

Fun Facts:
• I am a tech student who enjoys learning by practice
• I like solving coding problems
• I am improving my skills step by step
• Hobbies: coding, learning new tech topics, building small programs and explore new things
